Description: Training of neural networks using backpropagation,
    resilient backpropagation with (Riedmiller, 1994) or without
    weight backtracking (Riedmiller and Braun, 1993) or the
    modified globally convergent version by Anastasiadis et al.
    (2005). The package allows flexible settings through
    custom-choice of error and activation function. Furthermore,
    the calculation of generalized weights (Intrator O & Intrator
    N, 1993) is implemented.
